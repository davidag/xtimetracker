# Pull request guidelines

Before we merge a pull request, we check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  Please, write [commit messages that make
    sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
    and [rebase your
    branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) before
    submitting your pull request.
2.  One may ask you to [squash your
    commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)
    too. This is used to "clean" your pull request before merging it (we
    don't want commits such as fix tests, fix 2, fix 3, etc.).
3.  While creating your pull request on GitLab, you **must** write a
    description which gives the context and/or explains why you are
    creating it.
4.  The pull request **should** include tests.
5.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs **should** be
    updated.
6.  *TravisCI* integration tests should be **green** :) It will make
    sure the tests pass with every supported version of Python.

Thank you!
