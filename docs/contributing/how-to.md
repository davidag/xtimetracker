## Report bugs

Report bugs at <https://gitlab.com/davidalfonso/tt/-/issues>

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

-   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in
    troubleshooting.
-   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

## Fix bugs

Check out the [open bugs](https://gitlab.com/davidalfonso/tt/-/issues) -
anything tagged with the **[easy-pick]** label could be a good choice
for newcomers.

## Implement features

Look through the GitLab issues for features. Anything tagged with
**[enhancement]** is open to whoever wants to implement it.

## Write documentation

*tt* could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official docs, in docstrings, or even on the Web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

## Submit feedback

Any issue with the **[question]** label is open for feedback, so feel
free to share your thoughts with us!

The best way to send feedback is to [fill a new
issue](https://gitlab.com/davidalfonso/tt/-/issues/new) on GitLab.

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain how you envision it working. Try to be as detailed as you
    can.
-   Try to keep the scope as narrow as possible. This will help make it
    easier to implement.
-   Feel free to include any code you might already have, even if it's
    just a rough idea. This is a volunteer-driven project, and
    contributions are welcome :)
