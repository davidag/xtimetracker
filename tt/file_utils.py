    Save given content to file at given path safely.

    function taking one argument, a file object opened for writing. The
    function may write (unicode) strings to the file object (but doesn't need
    to close it).

    The file to write to is created at a temporary location first. If there is
    an error creating or writing to the temp file or calling `content`, the
    destination file is left untouched. Otherwise, if all is well, an existing
    destination file is backed up to `path` + `ext` (defaults to '.bak') and
    the temporary file moved into its place.
